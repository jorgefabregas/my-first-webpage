        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p> My name is Jorge, but since I arrived in Canada they called me George; therefore, you can call me the same too. I am from Chile, and the picture here belongs to The Andes Mountain, one of the lots of beautiful landscapes from my country.</p>
        <p>I am in Canada with my family, my wife and 3 kids. We arrived to Canada last year, and we were living in Winnipeg for 8 months, a city that, despite of the cold, is a very nice city. We are in Toronto since January.</p>
